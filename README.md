# ML Project 2

This is a basic Time Series Forecasting project based upon the Perrin Freres Monthly Champagne Sales dataset.
Since the data suggests seasonality, the SARIMAX model was used to predict sale trends for the next 16 months, based on the given data.
The project gives a basic understanding on how time series forecasting is carried out for a general dataset
